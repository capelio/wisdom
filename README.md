[The Mess We're In](https://youtu.be/lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong

Joe explores the importance behind reducing entropy and complexity in computers. He examines how near-infinite combinations of state make it exceptionally challenging to find solutions that solve many, much less all, categories of problems. His talk is thoughtful and holistic and entertaining all at the same time.
